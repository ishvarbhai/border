      <p align="center"> Paragraphs are the <b>building</b> blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at <i>least five sentences</i>, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. <u>In reality, though, the unity and <mark>coherence</mark> of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph</u>.  </p>
